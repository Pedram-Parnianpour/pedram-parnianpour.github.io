#### **1. [T1-weighted MRI texture analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients stratified by the D50 progression model](https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcae389)**  
*Brain Communications, 2024*

**Summary:**  
This study explores the potential of texture analysis on T1-weighted MRI images to reveal unique insights into the diverse progression patterns of ALS. We pushed the limits of texture analysis on 1.5 Tesla T1-weighted scans, stratifying patients by disease severity and stage using the D50 disease progression model. This model, which captures the sigmoidal trajectory of functional decline, allowed us to differentiate ALS progression with greater precision. Our findings indicate that texture analysis could be a promising biomarker for staging ALS.

#### **2. [Mismatch between clinically defined classification of ALS stage and the burden of cerebral pathology](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-024-12190-x)**  
*Journal of Neurology, 2024*

**Summary:**  
In our recent article, my colleagues and I embarked on a detailed investigation of the clinical stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the extent of cerebral pathology detected by texture analysis of T1-weighted brain images.

#### **3. [Accurate personalized survival prediction for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-47935-7)**  
*Scientific Reports, 2023*

**Summary:**  
Our new article delves into an innovative approach aimed at enhancing the management of ALS. It introduces a machine-learned tool designed to accurately predict the survival time of ALS patients, a critical factor in strategizing future treatments and care. 

This tool uniquely integrates clinical features with cortical thickness data derived from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, offering a novel method to estimate the time until a composite respiratory failure event in ALS patients. The article presents the prediction as individual survival distributions (ISDs), which provide a probIn the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) stands out for its rapid progression and the significant challenges it poses in patient care and treatment planning.

This tool uniquely integrates clinical features with cortical thickness data derived from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, offering a novel method to estimate the time until a composite respiratory failure event in ALS patients. The article presents the prediction as individual survival distributions (ISDs), which provide a probabilistic view of survival at various future time points for each patient. This approach represents a significant advancement in the predictive modeling for ALS and stands as a beacon of hope for patients and clinicians in tailoring more effective treatment plans.abilistic view of survival at various future time points for each patient.

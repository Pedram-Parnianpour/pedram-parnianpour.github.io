# Research Highlighted by ALS Canada

Our research was featured in the [April 2025 Research Update](https://als.ca/news/research-update-april-2025/) by ALS Canada.

This work focuses on using MRI-based texture analysis on 1.5 Tesla MRI along with the D50 model to better understand disease progression in ALS. We remain committed to advancing research that can ultimately lead to better diagnosis, stratification, and treatment strategies for ALS.

Thank you to ALS Canada for supporting.

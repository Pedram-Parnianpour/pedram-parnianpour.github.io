## Hi!

I'm **Pedram Parnianpour**, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia. I am currently working with Professor Erik P. Pioro on the application of **machine learning** and **computational modelling** in MRI/PET studies of **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and related disorders**.

I hold a **PhD in Neuroscience** from the University of Alberta, where I worked with Professor Sanjay Kalra on the application of **MRI-based techniques** and **texture analysis** to explore **cerebral degeneration and disease heterogeneity in ALS**.

## Research Interests

- Neuroimaging (structural & functional MRI)  
- ALS disease progression, stratification, and subtyping  
- Machine learning & deep learning for medical imaging  
- Biomarker development and predictive modelling

## Academic Highlights

- Delivered presentations at the **International Symposium on ALS/MND**, NEALS, iCNS, OHBM, and the Neuroimaging Society in ALS  
- Co-authored publications in *American Journal of Neuroradiology*, *Brain Communications*, *Scientific Reports*, *Journal of Neurology*, and more  
- Collaborated with global academic leaders and industry partners such as **Biogen Inc.** and **Trace Neuroscience**

## Teaching & Mentorship

I’ve taught and supported students in courses such as Biomedical Instrumentation, Neuroanatomy, Applied Linear Algebra, and Physics for Engineers, and supervised undergraduate research projects on brain imaging in ALS.
